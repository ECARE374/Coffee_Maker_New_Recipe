# Coffee_Maker_New_Recipe
ENSE 475 Lab U of R (Extra Recipe)

Our coffeemaker needs to be improved. We must implement the following features:

  • Edit a Recipe - public boolean editRecipe(Recipe recipe)

  • Add Inventory - public boolean addInventory(Inventory inventory)

Marketing has told us that we also need to improve our coffeemaker to include the ability to make:

  • Cappuccino

  • Latte

  • Expresso

  • Mocha
  
Research these and gather what ingredients are present. These new requirements may mean some redesign to the old coffeemaker.
Remember to write test first before creating application code.
