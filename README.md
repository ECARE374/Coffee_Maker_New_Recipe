# Coffee_Maker_New_Recipe
ENSE 475 Lab U of R (Extra Recipe)

Our coffeemaker needs to be improved. We must implement the following features:

  • Edit a Recipe - public boolean editRecipe(Recipe recipe)

  • Add Inventory - public boolean addInventory(Inventory inventory)

Marketing has told us that we also need to improve our coffeemaker to include the ability to make:

  • Cappuccino

  • Latte

  • Expresso

  • Mocha
  
You must research these and gather what ingredients are present. These new requirements may
mean some redesign to our coffeemaker. Do not worry about the mechanics of how these beverages
are made (our h/w team looks after this), we just need to be able to add the new recipes. Remember
to write your test first before creating application code.
